Q5. write a function in python to sort a list of numbers without using built-in functions
    dataset = [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54,79, 80,34,34,34,45,45]

Q6. Write a program that allows the user to enter any number of decimal numbers.
    Then the program should print the three highest numbers sorted by the highest number first.
    When entering the numbers, you must be able to type 'x' to end the entry.

	Exemple of how it may look is:
	Give a decimal number: 3
	Give a decimal number: 2
	Give a decimal number 12
	Give a decimal number: 88
	Three highest number are:
	----output----
	88
	12
	3

Q7. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 15
    Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the 
           guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

  
Output:

>>>Enter a guess number. 6
   Try one more time 
>>>Enter a guess number. 9
   Try one more time 
>>>Enter a guess number. 10
   Well guessed!
